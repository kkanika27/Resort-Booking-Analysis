Final Project
Rules of Engagement:
This is an honor system assignment: You may consult your professor, your lab instructor, the textbook, and material on the Internet at any time. You may not consult, collaborate, or seek assistance from any other human besides your professor and lab instructor. Your attribution statement, at the top of your R-code file, should reflect these constraints.

Here are the variables you will find in your data file:
• IsCanceled: Categorical Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0)
• LeadTime: Integer, Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into and the arrival date
• StaysInWeekendNights: Integer, Number of weekend nights (Saturday or Sunday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel
• StaysInWeekNights: Integer, Number of week nights (Monday to Friday) the guest stayed or booked to stay at the hotel
• Adults: Integer, Number of adults
• Children: Integer, Number of children
• Babies: Integer, Number of babies
• Meal: Categorical, Type of meal booked. Categories are presented in standard hospitality meal packages: Undefined/SC – no meal package; BB – Bed & Breakfast; HB – Half board (breakfast and one other meal – usually dinner); FB – Full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner)
• Country: Categorical, Country of origin. Categories are represented in the ISO 3155–3:2013 format
• MarketSegment: Categorical, Market segment designation. In categories, the term “TA” means “Travel Agents” and “TO” means “Tour Operators”
• IsRepeatedGuest: Categorical, Value indicating if the booking name was from a repeated guest (1) or not (0)
• PreviousCancellations: Integer, Number of previous bookings that were cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking
• PreviousBookingsNotCanceled: Integer, Number of previous bookings not cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking
• ReservedRoomType: Categorical, Code of room type reserved. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons
• AssignedRoomType: Categorical, Code for the type of room assigned to the booking. Sometimes the assigned room type differs from the reserved room type due to hotel operation reasons (e.g. overbooking) or by customer request. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons
• BookingChanges: Integer, Number of changes/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the PMS until the moment of check-in or cancellation
• DepositType: Categorical, Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking. This variable can assume three categories: No Deposit – no deposit was made. Non Refund – a deposit was made in the value of the total stay cost. Refundable – a deposit was made with a value under the total cost of stay.
• CustomerType: Categorical, Type of booking, assuming one of four categories: Contract - when the booking has an allotment or other type of contract associated to it; Group – when the booking is associated to a group; Transient – when the booking is not part of a group or contract, and is not associated to other transient booking; Transient-party – when the booking is transient, but is associated to at least other transient booking
• RequiredCardParkingSpaces: Integer, Number of car parking spaces required by the customer
• TotalOfSpecialRequests: Integer, Number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. twin bed or high floor)

REVIEW DATA
```{r}
str(df)
#displays the structure of the database
```

DATA PREPARATION

CHECKING FOR MISSING VALUES AND ATTRIBUTE TYPE
```{r}
newdf <- df[df$Adults!=0,]
View(newdf)
#As the data has less missing values, we drop the tables where adults is equal to 0
#It doesn’t make sense for a booking data to have a combination of 0 adults, 0 babies and 0 children.
```


STRUCTURE OF NEW DATASET
```{r}
str(newdf)
```



FINDING MISSING VALUES
```{r}
 
sum(is.na(df$IsCanceled)) #checking for missing values

```

CLASSIFYING THE UNIQUE VALUES
```{r}
unique(newdf$IsCanceled)
#calls the unique value of IsCanceled in newdf
class(newdf$IsCanceled)
#defines the class of the IsCanceled in newdf
```

DISPLAY TABLES
```{r}
table(newdf$IsCanceled) 
table(newdf$MarketSegment)
#count of each unique type
```
DATA EXPLORATION

DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKING CANCELLATIONS
```{r}
hist(newdf$IsCanceled,
main="BREAK DOWN OF BOOKING CANCELLATIONS",
col="lightblue",
labels = TRUE,breaks = 2,
xlab = "Booking Cancellations") 
#the histogram displays the distribution of booking cancelled and not cancelled
#here 0 means not canceled and 1 is canceled
#the frequency shows 11120 bookings were cancelled
```

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FEATURES AND THE TARGET VARIABLE

What are the customer types who are making reservations?
```{r}
table(newdf$CustomerType)
#count of each unique type

newdf$IsCanceled = as.factor(newdf$IsCanceled)
#Though the variable is factor, it is labeled as integer. So, it is to be converted into a factor

ggplot(newdf,aes(x=CustomerType, fill = IsCanceled)) + geom_bar() 
#This tables shows whether the guests are contract, group, transient or transient-party and with the number of each type. #And we also create a bar chat to show the visualization of the data. 
```

How most of the bookings were made? 
```{r}   
MarketSegment_plot <- ggplot(newdf, aes(MarketSegment, fill = IsCanceled)) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues")
MarketSegment_plot
#Most of the bookings were made online.
```


Display the bookings made by Deposit type
```{r}
newdf$DepositType <- as.factor(newdf$DepositType)
#converting deposit type to factor

table(newdf$DepositType)
#count of each unique type

DepositType_plot <- ggplot(newdf, aes(DepositType, fill = IsCanceled)) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
DepositType_plot


```
Display the number of special requests with cancellations
```{r}

table(newdf$TotalOfSpecialRequests)

SpecialRequests_plot <- ggplot(newdf, aes(TotalOfSpecialRequests, fill = IsCanceled)) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdPu")
SpecialRequests_plot
```


How often do repeated guests cancel booking? 
```{r}   

table(newdf$IsRepeatedGuest)
#count of each unique type

IsRepeatedGuest_plot <- ggplot(newdf) + aes(IsRepeatedGuest, fill = IsCanceled) + geom_bar() + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Accent")
IsRepeatedGuest_plot

# We can see that cancellation rate is less for repeated guests.
```




Lead time of booking cancellations 
```{r}
newdf$IsCanceled <- as.factor(newdf$IsCanceled)
newdf$LeadTime <- as.numeric(newdf$LeadTime)
newdf %>%
  mutate(CustomerType = fct_reorder(IsCanceled,LeadTime, .fun='median' )) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=CustomerType, y=LeadTime, fill=IsCanceled)) + 
    geom_boxplot(show.legend = TRUE) +
    xlab("IsCanceled") +
    xlab("") +
    xlab("")
```



Observe the countries with reservations and cancellations.
```{r}

dg <-joinCountryData2Map( newdf
,joinCode = "ISO3"
,nameJoinColumn = "Country")

mapDevice() #create world map shaped window
mapCountryData(dg
,nameColumnToPlot="IsCanceled",catMethod ="categorical", colourPalette = "terrain",addMapLegendBoxes, missingCountryCol = "pink", oceanCol="lightblue", 
borderCol = 2, mapTitle = "Reservations-Cancellation Map")

#This table shows the category of cancellations and which countries these cancellations are from.
```

From which country, are the resort guests are coming from? 
```{r}
table(newdf$Country)
#count of each unique type

dc <-joinCountryData2Map(newdf,joinCode = "ISO3",nameJoinColumn = "Country")
#for country codes we use joinCountryData2Map function where IS03 defines the 3 digit letter for countries

mapDevice() 
#create world map shaped window

mapCountryData(dc,nameColumnToPlot="CustomerType",catMethod ="categorical", colourPalette = "terrain",addMapLegendBoxes, missingCountryCol = "lightpink", oceanCol="lightblue", 
borderCol = 2, mapTitle = "Customer Group Type World Map")

#mapCountryData function helps to plot the customertype that is categorical and color paletter used in this map is terrain
#we have added legend boxed to define each customer type
#light pink displays the missingcountrycol as there are null values in the dataset
#oceanCol displays the ocean color
```

Top 5 countries with total bookings
```{r}
top_countries<- newdf %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarise(total_bookings = n())
#The function n() returns the number of observations in a current group.
top_countries <- top_countries %>% arrange(desc(total_bookings))
top_countries <- top_countries[1:5,]
#Top 5 countries with most bookings
top_countries
```

Displaying the total bookings in top 5 countries
```{r}
ggplot(data = top_countries, aes(x = Country, y = total_bookings, fill= Country)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.5)
```
The country with the most reservations is Portugal. Portugal accounted for 17630 of the total bookings, with the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, and France following closely after.


Display cancellations of bookings in percentage 
```{r}
cancellations <- df %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarise(total_bookings = n(), total_cancellations = sum(IsCanceled))
cancellations <- cancellations %>% mutate(PercentageOfCancellation = total_cancellations*100/total_bookings)
cancellations <- cancellations[cancellations$total_bookings >= 100,]
#Only considering those countries where there have been atleast 50 bookings
cancellations <- cancellations %>% arrange(desc(PercentageOfCancellation))
#Arranging cancellations based on descending order
cancellations <- cancellations[1:5,]
#Top 5 countries with highest percentages of cancellations
cancellations
```



```{r}
ggplot(data = cancellations, aes(x = Country, y = PercentageOfCancellation)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.5)+ geom_text(aes(label= PercentageOfCancellation), size=5, vjust = -0.5)
```
Portugal is also the country with the highest percentage of cancellations, followed by Russia, Switzerland, Sweden, and Brazil. In Portugal, about 42% of the confirmed reservations were canceled.


Difference in Total Bookings vs Total Cancellations
```{r}
df$difference <- ifelse(df$ReservedRoomType == df$AssignedRoomType, "Yes", "No")
assigned_room <- df %>% group_by(difference) %>% summarise(total_bookings = n(), total_cancellations = sum(IsCanceled))
assigned_room <- assigned_room %>% mutate(PercentageOfCancellation = total_cancellations*100/total_bookings)
assigned_room
```
Visualizing the difference in percentage of cancellations
```{r}
ggplot(data = assigned_room, aes(x = difference, y = PercentageOfCancellation, fill = difference)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.3)+ geom_text(aes(label= PercentageOfCancellation), size=5, vjust = -0.5)
```
Relationship between StaysInWeekendNights and StaysInWeekNights
```{r}
sct_nightstays<- ggplot(data= newdf) + aes(x = StaysInWeekendNights, y=StaysInWeekNights) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x)
 
sct_nightstays
```


Relationship between PreviousCancellations and PreviousBookingsNotCanceled
```{r}
sct_previouscancellation<- ggplot(data= newdf) + aes(x = PreviousCancellations, y=PreviousBookingsNotCanceled) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x)
 
sct_previouscancellation
```



Relationship between reserved room type and assigned room type
```{r}
sct_roomtype<- ggplot(data=newdf) + aes(x=ReservedRoomType, y=AssignedRoomType) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x)
 
sct_roomtype
#nonlinear relationship- An increase in one variable does not result in a proportional increase or decrease in the other variable.
```


MODEL PREPARATION

Relation between cancellation status and the target variable 
```{r}
newdf$MarketSegment <- as.numeric(newdf$MarketSegment)
newdf$IsCanceled <- as.numeric(newdf$IsCanceled)

lm1 = lm(formula = IsCanceled ~ PreviousCancellations + DepositType + LeadTime + StaysInWeekNights + Adults + Children + Babies + Meal + Country + IsRepeatedGuest + PreviousBookingsNotCanceled + ReservedRoomType + AssignedRoomType + BookingChanges + CustomerType + RequiredCarParkingSpaces + TotalOfSpecialRequests, data = newdf)

summary(lm1)


```



More Significant
```{r}

lm2 <- lm(formula = IsCanceled ~ PreviousCancellations + DepositType + LeadTime + StaysInWeekNights + Adults + Children + Babies + BookingChanges + RequiredCarParkingSpaces + TotalOfSpecialRequests, data = newdf)
summary(lm2)
```


CROSS VALIDATION
The best way to validate or compare models performance is by splitting the data into train and validation. The train data will be used to train the model, and the validation data is used to obtain the evaluation score.
```{r}
dfs <- newdf[,1:10]
#subsetting the columns/ 10 variables of df and storing it in dfs
dfs$IsCanceled <- as.factor(dfs$IsCanceled)
str(dfs)
#displaying the structure of the data frame
```

Data partition
```{r}
dftrain <- createDataPartition(y=dfs$IsCanceled,p=.30,list=FALSE)

nrow(dftrain)
```

```{r}
dftrainSet <-dfs[dftrain,]
dftestSet <- dfs[dftrain,]
#dftrainSet =subset(dfs, dftrain == TRUE)
#dftestSet = subset(dfs, dftrain == FALSE)
```

```{r}
dim(dftrainSet)
```



Model Evaluation
```{r}
dftree <- rpart(IsCanceled~., data = dftrainSet)
dftree      
```

Decision tree visualization
```{r}
rpart.plot(dftree)
```
Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance

Use the **predict()** function to predict the test data, and then generate a **confusion matrix** to explore the results
```{r}
dfpred <- predict(dftree, newdata = dftestSet, type = "class")

dfconf <-confusionMatrix (dfpred, dftestSet$IsCanceled)
dfconf
```
#With 81% accuracy, the model performed just fine, its not bad. The model also has an incredible 89% recall, which means that the model did a good job predicting not canceled bookings




RANDOM FOREST - supervised - builds multiple decision tree known as forest
```{r}
rf <- randomForest(IsCanceled ~ ., data = dftrainSet )
rf
#Random forests are much more efficient than decision trees while performing on large databases.
```
```{r}
rfpred <- predict(rf, newdata = dftestSet, type ="class")


rfconf <-confusionMatrix (rfpred, dftestSet$IsCanceled)
rfconf
```
